Developed by: Muhammad Munir

The application was developed on Mac on visual studio code using python 3.8.2

To run the application:
    1. Make sure you have python installed and open a terminal, which can run python, to check this in your terminal type python3 --version, if a version of python is not returned please install python3 for the project to work.
    2. Provide the python3 command and write the name of the python file in the folder, in this case DecisionTree.py
    3. Supply the first command line argument for the training set of data on which the algorithm will be trained
    4. Provide the second command line argument for the test set against which the alogorithm will be evaluated for test accuracy

The learning curve is supplied as well, as you can see the learning curve depicts the fact that after a certain period of time increasing the size of training set does not help the accuracy of the model that much and slowly the training accuracy reaches a plateau.
